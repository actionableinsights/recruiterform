                he meets all reasonable deadlines for the completion of Jobs set by the Company or the Client. 3.4 If the Contractor is unable to provide the Services due to illness or injury, he shall advise the Company of that fact as soon as is reasonably

                entitling the Company to terminate this agreement pursuant to clause 18.1 immediately without notice. 5.3 Where a Contractor is interested in subcontracting any Job to a third party (the “Sub-Contractor“), he must notify the Company of
                the name, age and nationality of the Sub-Contractor and provide the Company, on request, with details and evidence of the Sub-Contractor’s qualifications. On receipt of such information, the Company shall be permitted to perform checks

                or part of any Job, the Consultant shall procure that the Sub-Contractor signs an agreement with the Contractor substantially in the terms of this Agreement save that the Company shall have no obligation to pay the Sub-Contractor for any
                work performed by such Sub-Contractor in relation to a Job. 5.6 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no obligation to make any payment to the Sub-Contractor including without limitation any fees due to the Sub-Contractor
                from the Contractor for any work performed by the Sub-Contractor in relation to any Job and any taxes that may be assessed in relation to the Sub-Contractor’s work on any Job. 5.7 The Company may in its sole and absolute discretion and
                without giving a reason withdraw its approval of any Sub-Contractor and/or its consent for such Sub-Contractor to work on any Job. In such circumstances, the Consultant shall procure that the Sub-Contractor immediately ceases to work on
                the relevant Job(s). 5.8 Where an approved Sub-Contractor performs all or part of a Job, the Contractor shall at all times remain responsible for the quality and accuracy of the work performed by the Sub-Contractor, and for ensuring that
                any minimum performance criteria (as published by the Company from time to time) are adhered to by the Sub-Contractor. 6. FEES AND PAYMENTS 6.1 The fee for every Job shall be as stated on the Job Board. 6.2 Notwithstanding clause 2.3,
                there is no obligation on the Consultant to take on a Job. 6.3 On the 21st day of each month during the Engagement the Contractor shall submit by email to the Company an invoice giving details of the Services provided during the previous
                calendar month and the fees payable for the performance of such Services (plus VAT if applicable). All fees submitted must relate to Jobs which have passed the Company’s quality checks as set out herein. 6.4 In consideration of the provision
                of the Services during the Engagement, the Company shall pay each invoice submitted by the Contractor in accordance with clause 6.1 within 7 Business Days of receipt. 6.5 The Company shall be entitled to require that the Consultant to
                amend any invoice to reflect a deduction from the fees due for any Deadline Penalty (as defined below) or other permitted deductions set out in this agreement and the Consultant shall modify the invoice accordingly. 6.6 The Company reserves
                the right to withhold payments to the Consultant, where in its sole and absolute discretion, the Services provided by the Consultant are unsatisfactory and any Job may need to be refunded. 6.7 Payment in full or in part of the fees claimed
                by the Consultant under this clause 6 or any expenses shall be without prejudice to any claims or rights of the Company or any Group Company against the Consultant in respect of the provision of the Services. 6.8 The Company shall be entitled
                to deduct from the fees (and any other sums due to the Consultant) any sums that the Consultant may owe to the Company or any Group Company from time to time. 6.9 Payment in full or in part of the fees claimed under clause 6.1 or any expenses
                shall be without prejudice to any claims or rights of the Company or any Group Company against the Consultant in respect of the provision of the Services. 7. EMPLOYEE AND CONSULTANT 7.1 Where the Consultant is also an employee of the Company:
                (a) he shall sign both this agreement and an employment agreement; and (b) where there are conflicting provisions between this agreement and his employment contract, the provisions in his employment contract shall govern and shall override
                the conflicting provisions in this agreement. 7.2 The Consultant shall not undertake any Job for the Company or its Clients, until he has received written confirmation from the Management that he has been classed as a “writer” by the Company
                and is permitted to undertake Jobs. 7.3 Unless prior written approval has been received from Management, no Consultant shall undertake a Job if he was also responsible for making the sale . 7.4 Consultants shall treat each Client equally
                and shall not offer preferential treatment (whether in relation to price, deadline or otherwise) to any consultant, writer, Client, employee, colleague, friend or family member without receipt of the prior written consent of Management.
                7.5 No variation to a term of a Job shall be agreed with a Client without the prior written consent of Management. 7.6 If the Consultant is also employed by the Company, he shall not allow writing tasks to interfere with employee, contractor
                or subcontractor duties within the Company. Jobs can never be used as an excuse for failure to complete tasks or responsibilities arising from his employment. Extension on responsibilities may only be granted explicitly in writing by the
                Company or Management. 8. QUALITY 8.1 On acceptance of a Job: (a) the Consultant shall make sure that he is comfortable with the fee being paid, can meet the Deadline and can satisfy the Performance Standard (as defined below); and (b)
                agrees to complete the Job by the Deadline; and (c) warrants that the work undertaken in respect of the Job shall meet the Performance Standard (as defined below). 8.2 In performing a Job, the Consultant shall utilise the resources required
                by the Company and required to meet the requisite Performance Standard (which shall include without limitation academic journals, market reports and books when writing essays, reports or dissertations that require such references) and
                shall write each Job to the stipulated standard. 8.3 If for any reason, the Consultant feels that the Job description is insufficient or misleading, the Consultant may request approval from the Management to amend the Job description or
                write a note to the Client requesting appropriate clarification. 8.4 If amendments are required to the work which were not in the Job description, the Consultant shall be compensated for the additional time spent on the Job at a rate determined
                in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. 8.5 If the Consultant’s work is reasonably deemed not to have met the Performance Standards and the Consultant is unable to amend the work for any reason, the Company reserves the right
                to have the Job completed by another Consultant in which case the Company shall deduct the new Consultant’s fee from any payments which would have been due to the Consultant. Any decision under this clause 8.5 may be challenged by the
                Consultant by notice in writing to the Management. 9. AMENDMENTS 9.1 The Consultant undertakes to perform all amendments requested by the Company or a Client within the period of 24 hours of receiving the amendments either from the Client
                of the Company. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that work performed by the Consultant in relation to a Job shall only be passed to the Client after the quality assurance team of the Company has reviewed and accepted the work. 9.2
                If the Consultant submits work which fails to meet the Job description, and the Consultant is unable to amend the work within the required timeframe, the Company reserves the right not to pay the Consultant for the Job. 9.3 If the Consultant
                is unable to amend the work within the timeframe required, the Company reserves the right to subcontract any required amendments to another writer at the Consultant’s cost. 10. DEADLINE 10.1 The Company reserves the right to: (a) deduct
                up to 50% of the fee (the “Deadline Penalty“) due to the Consultant for the Job if the Consultant fails to complete the Job by the Deadline; (b) remove the Consultant from a Job if he: (i) does not maintain adequate communication with
                the Company during the period in which the Job is meant to be being performed; and (ii) does not adequately demonstrate to the Company (in the reasonable opinion of Management) on request during the period in which he is meant to be performing
                the Job that the Job is being performed and will be completed prior to the Deadline. 10.2 The Consultant shall alert Management at the earliest opportunity if he foresees any problem with meeting the Deadline. Management shall be permitted
                in its sole and absolute discretion to extend the Deadline. 10.3 For the purposes of clause 10.1, if Management grant an extension to the Deadline, no penalty shall be imposed. If Management does not grant an extension to the Deadline,
                the Consultant shall remain obligated to complete the Job by the original Deadline. 10.4 No extension to a Deadline shall be valid unless the Consultant has received written confirmation of such extension from the Company. 10.5 The Consultant
                shall be solely responsible for getting the completed Job to the Client by the Deadline. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the first submission to the Company is the initial draft, which is subject to a quality review by
                the Company; (b) the initial draft may be returned to the Consultant for amendment. (c) all further drafts must be submitted to the Company for review and the final version is the version which the Company confirm is of an appropriate
                quality for submission to the Client. In order to meet the Deadline, the Consultant must submit the final version to the Client prior to the Deadline. 10.6 Any work considered incomplete in the opinion of the Company at the Deadline shall
                be classified as having missed the Deadline and shall be subject to the Deadline Penalty in accordance with clause 10.1. 12. EXPENSES The Consultant shall bear his own expenses incurred in the course of the Engagement. 13. OTHER ACTIVITIES
                13.1 Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the Contractor from being engaged, concerned or having any financial interest in any Capacity in any other business, trade, profession or occupation during the Engagement provided that: (a)
                such activity does not cause a breach of any of the Contractor’s obligations under this agreement; (b) not solicit or endeavour to entice away from the Company the business or custom of any Client with a view to providing goods or services
                to that Client in competition with the Business of the Company; or (c) the Contractor shall give priority to the provision of the Services to the Company over any other business activities undertaken by the Contractor during the course
                of the Engagement. 13.2 For 12 months after the Termination Date, the Consultant shall (a) not solicit or endeavour to entice away from the Company the business or custom of any Client with whom he worked with a view to providing goods

                to register any of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Works, nor any of the Inventions, unless requested to do so by The Company; and (e) to do all acts necessary to confirm that absolute title in all Intellectual Property Rights

                nor any of the Intellectual Property Rights in the Works; (b) he is unaware of any use by any third party of any of the Works or Intellectual Property Rights in the Works; and (c) the use of the Works or the Intellectual Property Rights
                in the Works by the Company will not infringe the rights of any third party. 16.4 The Contractor agrees to indemnify the Company and keep it indemnified at all times against all or any costs, claims, damages or expenses incurred by the
                Company, or for which the Company may become liable, with respect to any intellectual property infringement claim or other claim relating to the Works or Inventions supplied by the Contractor of the Company during the course of providing
                the Services. 16.5 The Contractor waives any moral rights in the Works to which he is now or may at any future time be entitled under Chapter IV of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 or any similar provisions of law in any jurisdiction,
                including (but without limitation) the right to be identified, the right of integrity and the right against false attribution, and agrees not to institute, support, maintain or permit any action or claim to the effect that any treatment,
                exploitation or use of such Works or other materials infringes the Contractor’s moral rights. 16.6 The Contractor acknowledges that, except as provided by law, no further fees or compensation other than those provided for in this agreement
                are due or may become due to the Contractor in respect of the performance of his obligations under this clause 16. 16.7 The Contractor undertakes, at the expense of the Company, at any time either during or after the Engagement, to execute
                all documents, make all applications, give all assistance and do all acts and things as may, in the opinion of the Company or Management, be necessary or desirable to vest the Intellectual Property Rights in, and to register them in, the
                name of the Company and to defend the Company against claims that works embodying Intellectual Property Rights or Inventions infringe third party rights, and otherwise to protect and maintain the Intellectual Property Rights in the Works
                and the Inventions. 16.8 The Contractor hereby irrevocably appoints the Company to be his attorney to execute and do any such instrument or thing and generally to use his name for the purpose of giving the Company or its nominee the benefit
                of this clause 17 and acknowledges in favour of a third party that a certificate in writing signed by any director or the secretary of the Company that any instrument or act falls within the authority conferred by this clause 16 shall
                be conclusive evidence that this is the case. 16.9 For the avoidance of doubt. the Intellectual Property Rights in any content, documents or systems created for or by the Company which directly relate to the Company, the Business of the
                Company and the Service shall at all times belong to the Company. 16.10 All working tools (including but not limited to writing standards, email templates, Client notes, sales or marketing strategy, or any other documents or guides) given
                to the Company by the Contractor, or created by the Contractor during his Engagement with the Company shall represent the intellectual property of the Company. Such working tools may not be copied, sold or used for any reason other than
                performance of the Services to Clients on behalf of the Company. 17. COMPANY PROPERTY 17.1 All Company Property shall at all times remain the property of the Company. 17.2 All Company Property provided to the Contractor during the Engagement
                shall be used exclusively for providing the Services to Client on behalf of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any material use of the Company Property for any other reason shall constitute a material breach of this agreement which
                shall entitle the Company to terminate this agreement immediately without notice pursuant to clause 18.1. 17.3 The Contractor may not sell, transfer or gift (or procure or permit any other person to sell, transfes or gift) any Company
                Property to any third party. 18. TERMINATION 18.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 2.2, the Company may terminate the Engagement with immediate effect with no liability to make any further payment to the Contractor (other than
                in respect of amounts accrued before the Termination Date) if at any time the Contractor: (a) commits any gross misconduct affecting the Business of the Company or any Group Company; (b) commits any breach of Clauses 5.1 and 17.2; (c)
                provides a false transcript, proof of identity, address, or certificate, or CV containing material inaccuracies; (d) commits any serious or repeated breach or non-observance of any of the provisions of this agreement or refuses or neglects
                to comply with any reasonable and lawful directions of the Company; (e) is convicted of any criminal offence (other than an offence under any road traffic legislation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere for which a fine or non-custodial
                penalty is imposed); (f) is in the reasonable opinion of the Management negligent or incompetent in the performance of the Services; (g) is declared bankrupt or makes any arrangement with or for the benefit of his creditors or has a county
                court administration order made against him under the County Court Act 1984; (h) commits any fraud or dishonesty or acts in any manner which in the opinion of the Company or Management brings or is likely to bring the Contractor or the
                Company or any Group Company into disrepute or is materially adverse to the interests of the Company or any Group Company. 18.2 The rights of the Company under this clause 18 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have
                at law to terminate the Engagement or to accept any breach of this agreement on the part of the Contractor as having brought the agreement to an end. Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights to terminate shall not constitute a
                waiver of these rights. 18.3 The Contractor shall not be permitted to terminate this agreement pursuant to Clause 2.3(b) unless all Jobs allocated to the Contractor have been completed. 18.4 The Company reserves the right to withhold payment
                of any sums due to the Contractor if the Contractor purports to terminate this agreement other than in accordance with clause 18.3. 19. OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION On the Termination Date the Contractor shall: (a) immediately deliver to
                the Company all Company Property in his possession or under his control; (b) irretrievably delete any information relating to the Business of the Company or any Group Company stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory and all matter

                relationship of the Contractor to the Company will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this agreement shall render him an employee, worker, agent or partner of the Company and the Contractor shall not hold himself out as such.
                20.2 This agreement constitutes a contract for the provision of services and not a contract of employment and accordingly the Contractor shall be fully responsible for and shall indemnify the Company or any Group Company for and in respect
                of: (a) any income tax, National Insurance and social security contributions and any other liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from or made in connection with the performance of the Services, where the recovery
                is not prohibited by law. The Contractor shall further indemnify the Company against all reasonable costs, expenses and any penalty, fine or interest incurred or payable by the Company in connection with or in consequence of any such liability,
                deduction, contribution, assessment or claim other than where the latter arise out of the Company’s negligence or willful default; (b) any liability arising from any employment-related claim or any claim based on worker status (including
                reasonable costs and expenses) brought by the Contractor or any Substitute against the Company arising out of or in connection with the provision of the Services. 21. NOTICES 21.1 Any notice given under this agreement shall be in writing
                and signed by or on behalf of the party giving it and shall be served by sending it via email to the email address notified by the relevant party to the other party. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been received 24 hours from the
                time it was sent. 21.2 In proving such service it shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was transmitted by email to the email address of the relevant party. 22. VARIATION No variation of this agreement or of any of the documents
                referred to in it shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of each of the parties. 23. COUNTERPARTS This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall
                be an original, and all the counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND PREVIOUS CONTRACTS 24.1 Each party on behalf of itself (and, in the case of the Company, as agent for any Group Companies)
                acknowledges and agrees with the other party (the Company acting on behalf of itself and as agent for each Group Company) that: (a) this agreement together with any documents referred to in it constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
                between the Consultant and the Company and any Group Company and supersedes any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between them relating to the Engagement (which shall be deemed to have been terminated by mutual consent);
                (b) in entering into this agreement neither party nor any Group Company has relied on any Pre-Contractual Statement; and (c) each party agrees that the only rights and remedies available to it or arising out of or in connection with any
                Pre-Contractual Statement shall be for breach of contract. Nothing in this agreement shall, however, limit or exclude any liability for fraud. 25. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS 25.1 Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this agreement a person
                who is not a party to this agreement shall not have any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists, or
                is available, apart from under that Act. 25.2 The rights of the parties to terminate, rescind or agree any variation, waiver or settlement under this agreement are not subject to the consent of any person that is not a party to this agreement.
                26. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION 26.1 This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed
                in accordance with English law. 26.2 The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject
                matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). 27. Entry into this agreement 27.1 By providing Services to the Company, you agree to be bound by the provisions of this agreement as does the Company. 27.2 For the purposes
